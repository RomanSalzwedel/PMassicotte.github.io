        <title>Visualizating olympics medals in R</title>
        <description>
          
          Recently I have been more interested to perform web scraping to extract public data to perform data analysis. There are probably many R packages out there that do a good job at such task, but I found out that the rvest was among the most popular ones. Hence I decided...

          How to remove elements that are not in a list - 
          It is easy to verify if elements are within a list using the %in% operator in R. For example: c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) %in% letters[1:5] #&amp;gt; [1] TRUE TRUE However, I am often in a situation where I need to do the opposite. This can be easily achieved using the Negate() function....

        <title>R 101</title>
        <description>
