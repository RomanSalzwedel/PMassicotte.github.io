```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

It is easy to verify if elements are within a list using the `%in%` operator in R. For example:

```{r}
c("a", "b") %in% letters[1:5]
```

However, I am often in a situation where I need to do the opposite. This can be easily achieved using the `Negate()` function.


```{r}
`%ni%` <- Negate(`%in%`)
c("a", "b") %ni% letters[1:5]
```

VoilÃ !
