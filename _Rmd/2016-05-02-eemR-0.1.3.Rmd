[eemR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/eemR/index.html) has been updated to v0.1.3 and brings a lot of new features. Among the most interesting ones:

- Shiny support: You can interactively visualize EEMS by using `interactive = TRUE`. Ex.: `plot(X, interactive = TRUE)`.

- [A vignette has been added](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/eemR/vignettes/introduction.html).

- - `eem_remove_blank()` and `eem_raman_normalisation()` can now try to implicitly use a blank eem from a `eemlist` object (#20). If blank is omitted (`blank = NA`), the functions will try to extract the blank from the `eemlist` object. This is done by looking for sample names containing one of these complete or partial strings (ignoring case):
      - "nano"
      - "miliq"
      - "milliq"
      - "mq"
      - "blank"

```{r}
library(eemR)
library(magrittr)

folder <- system.file("inst/extdata/cary/", package = "eemR")

eems <- eem_read(folder, recursive = TRUE) %>%
  eem_raman_normalisation() %>%
  eem_remove_scattering(type = "raman", order = 1) %>%
  eem_remove_scattering(type = "rayleigh", order = 1)

plot(eems, which = 3)
```
