The [`eemR`](https://github.com/PMassicotte/eemR) package implements various functions used calculate metrics from excitation-emission matrix (EEM) as well as to preform pre-processing corrections before PARAFAC analysis. All functions from this package start with the `eem_` prefix. Please note this is a very alpha version of the package for testing purpose only.

```{r}
library(eemR)
ls("package:eemR")
```

The package can be installed using the following command.

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("PMassicotte/eemR")
```

## Reading excitation-emission

At the moment, to following EEM types are supported:

- Cary Eclipse `.csv` files
- Aqualog `.dat` files

EEM can be read using the `eem_read()` function. *Please fill an [issue](https://github.com/PMassicotte/eemR/issues) if you have other file formats you would like to add to the package*.

```{r}
library(eemR)

## Reading a single eem
file <- system.file("extdata/cary/eem", "sample1.csv", package = "eemR")
eem <- eem_read(file)

plot(eem)

```

# Implemented metrics

The current implemented metrics are:

1. The fluorescence index (FI).

2. The fluorescence peaks.

3. The fluorescence humification index (HIX).

4. The biological fluorescence index (BIX).

```{r, warning = FALSE}

library(eemR)

folder <- system.file("extdata/cary/eem", package = "eemR")
eem <- eem_read(folder)

eem_fluorescence_index(eem)

eem_coble_peaks(eem)

eem_humification_index(eem)

eem_biological_index(eem)

```

# PARAFAC pre-processing

Three types of correction are currently supported:

1. `eem_remove_blank()` which subtract a water blank from the eem.

2. `eem_remove_scattering()` which remove both *Raman* and *Rayleigh* scattering.

3. `eem_raman_normalisation()` which normalize EEM fluoresence intensities.

4. `eem_inner_filter()` which correct for both primary and secondary inner-filter effect.

## Removing Raman and Rayleigh scattering (1st and 2nd order)

The `eem_remove_scattering()` function removes both Raman and Rayleigh scattering from EEMs.

```{r, out.width='300cm', out.height='250cm', fig.show='hold'}

file <- system.file("extdata/cary/eem", "sample1.csv", package = "eemR")
eem <- eem_read(file)

res <- eem_remove_scattering(eem = eem, type = "raman", order = 1, width = 10)
res <- eem_remove_scattering(eem = res, type = "rayleigh", order = 1, width = 10)

plot(eem)
plot(res)

```

## Blank removal

The `eem_remove_blank()` function subtract blank (miliq) water from eem. Scatter bands can often be reduced by subtracting water blank.

```{r}

file <- system.file("extdata/cary", "nano.csv", package = "eemR")
blank <- eem_read(file)

res <- eem_remove_blank(res, blank)

plot(res)
```

## Raman normalization

The `eem_raman_normalisation()` function implement a simple calibration method for fluorescence intensity using only the integrated area of a water Raman peak.

```{r}

res <- eem_raman_normalisation(res, blank)

plot(res)
```

## Inner-filter effect correction

To account for reabsorption of the light emitted by fluorophores in the water, absorbance spectra are used for correction of both primary and secondary inner filtering effects in the EEMs.

```{r}

data("absorbance")

res <- eem_inner_filter_effect(res, absorbance, 1)

plot(res)
```

## Export to Matlab

PARAFAC analysis was made easy with the fantastic Matlab [`drEEM`](http://www.models.life.ku.dk/drEEM) toolbox. The function `eem_export_matlab()` can be  used to export the EEMs into a `m-file` directly usable in Matlab by the `drEEM` toolbox.

```{r}
folder <- system.file("extdata/cary/eem", package = "eemR")
eem <- eem_read(folder)

filename <- paste(tempfile(), ".mat", sep = "")

eem_export_matlab(filename, eem)

```

Note that the name of the structure generated by the function will be `OriginalData` to *complement* with PARAFAC standard. Then, the importation into Matlab is made easy using the `load()` function.

```matlab
load('FileName.mat');
```
