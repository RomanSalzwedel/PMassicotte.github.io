## EEM (excitation-emission fluorescence matrix)

The eemR package implements various functions used calculate metrics from excitation-emission matrix (EEM) as well as to preform pre-processing corrections before PARAFAC analysis. All functions from this package start with the eem_ prefix. Please note this is a very alpha version of the package for testing purpose only.

```{r}
library(eemR)
ls("package:eemR")
```

```{r}
library(eemR)

## Reading a single eem
file <- system.file("extdata/cary/eem", "sample1.csv", package = "eemR")
eem <- eem_read(file)

plot(eem)

```
