```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Recently I have been more interested to perform web scraping to extract public data to perform data analysis. There are probably many R packages out there that do a good job at such task, but I found out that the [rvest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/index.html) was among the most popular ones. Hence I decided to give it a try.

In this post, I'm using the `rvest` library to visualize how many medals were obtained by each country during the summer Olympics 2016. I thought it would be a first good exercise to get my hands around it.

## Extracting data from web

First, let's extract medals count information from the web. Here we are going to use data from [NBC](http://www.nbcolympics.com/medals) website.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(rvest)
library(dplyr)

url1 <- "http://www.nbcolympics.com/medals"

medals <- read_html(url1) %>%
  html_nodes("table") %>%
  .[[1]] %>%
  html_table()

knitr::kable(head(medals))
```

## Get country codes and tidy the data

We are now almost ready to plot the data. I thought it would be interesting to enhance the visualization by associating each country to its flag. To do so, I first need to extract the two-characters ISO code for each country using the [contrycode](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/countrycode/index.html) package. This is pretty straightforward using the `countrycode()` function. The next few lines are only used to tidy the data so it works well with `ggplot2`.

```{r}
library(countrycode)
library(tidyr)

medals <- medals %>%
  mutate(code = countrycode(Country, "country.name", "iso2c")) %>%
  mutate(code = tolower(code)) %>%
  gather(medal_color, count, Gold, Silver, Bronze) %>%
  mutate(medal_color = factor(medal_color, levels = c("Gold", "Silver", "Bronze"))) %>%
  rename(country = Country) %>%
  drop_na(country, code)

knitr::kable(head(medals))
```

## Plotting the data

Using `ggplot2` it is easy to plot the data. Do not forget to install the `ggflags` package from Github using `devtools::install_github("baptiste/ggflags")`.

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 10}

# devtools::install_github("baptiste/ggflags")
library(ggplot2)
library(ggflags)

medals %>%
  filter(Total >= 10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(country, Total), y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = medal_color)) +
  geom_flag(y = -7, aes(country = code), size = 10) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(
    angle = 90,
    hjust = 1,
    size = 7,
    vjust = 0.5
  )) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "Gold" = "gold",
    "Bronze" = "#cd7f32",
    "Silver" = "#C0C0C0"
  )) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0.1, 1)) +
  xlab("Country") +
  ylab("Number of medals") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.justification = c(1, 0), legend.position = c(1, 0)) +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +
  coord_flip()

```

As simple as that!
