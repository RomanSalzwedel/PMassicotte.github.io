I am pleased to introduce the `cdom` R package for optical ecologists. This package offers various tools to model and extract quantitative information from absorption profil of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) spectra. 

```{r}
library(cdom)
data("spectra")

plot(spectra$wavelength, spectra$spc1)
```
