#### Hi, my name is Philippe Massicotte.

The unifying theme of my research is oriented toward better understanding how the surrounding landscapes of aquatic ecosystems determine the biogeocycling of **dissolved organic matter** (DOM) subsequently aquatic ecosystem functioning. Most of the projects that I led have involved the use of [absorption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_spectroscopy) and [fluorescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_spectroscopy) spectroscopy. My researches also often also involve the use of spectral imagery, GIS and several spatial analyzes.

I am an heavy user of the [R statistical computing language](https://www.r-project.org/). Using R is part of my everyday work both for environmental modeling or data manipulation. This not-so-serious blog is about using R in environmental sciences.

*Dr. Massicotte obtained a Ph.D. in environmental sciences in 2012, followed by two-years as a post-doc in Quebec, Canada. He is currently working at Aarhus University in Denmark with [Prof. Stiig Markager](http://pure.au.dk/portal/da/persons/stiig-markager(3f2ea381-8e5d-4ef4-8088-bc990dbc4a13).html). The theme of his current research project is to better understand bio-optics and the dynamics of colored dissolved organic matter in natural aquatic ecosystems.*
