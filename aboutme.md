I am a *political science* student at Humboldt-University Berlin. The [R statistical computing language](https://www.r-project.org/) is an important part of my daily work flow. I mainly use R for data manipulation and statistical models. In the future, I hope to present my recent R work on this website.

The unifying theme of my research is oriented toward better understanding how surrounding landscapes of aquatic ecosystems determine the biogeocycling of **dissolved organic matter** (DOM). DOM is one of the main agents driving optical properties of aquatic ecosystems and subsequently their functioning. Most of the projects that I led have involved the use of [absorption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_spectroscopy) and [fluorescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_spectroscopy) spectroscopy to better understand the biogeocycling of DOM.

Please do not hesitate to [contact me](contact) and I hope you will like this blog.

> Dr. Massicotte obtained a Ph.D. in environmental sciences in 2012, followed by two-years as a post-doc in Quebec, Canada. He is currently working at Aarhus University in Denmark with [Prof. Stiig Markager](http://pure.au.dk/portal/da/persons/stiig-markager(3f2ea381-8e5d-4ef4-8088-bc990dbc4a13).html). The theme of his current research project is to better understand bio-optics and the dynamics of colored dissolved organic matter in natural aquatic ecosystems.
