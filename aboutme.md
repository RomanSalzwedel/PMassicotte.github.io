As a *numerical ecologsist*, the [R statistical computing language](https://www.r-project.org/) is an important part of my daily work flow. I mainly use R for environmental modeling and data manipulation. In this not-so-serious blog I will present my recent R work as well as basic tips and tricks about R.

The unifying theme of my research is oriented toward better understanding how surrounding landscapes of aquatic ecosystems determine the biogeocycling of **dissolved organic matter** (DOM). DOM is one of the main agents driving optical properties of aquatic ecosystems and subsequently their functioning. Most of the projects that I led have involved the use of [absorption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_spectroscopy) and [fluorescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_spectroscopy) spectroscopy to better understand the biogeocycling of DOM.

Please do not hesitate to [contact me](contact) and I hope you will like this blog.

> Dr. Massicotte obtained a Ph.D. in environmental sciences in 2012, followed by two-years as a post-doc in Quebec, Canada. He is currently working at Aarhus University in Denmark with [Prof. Stiig Markager](http://pure.au.dk/portal/da/persons/stiig-markager(3f2ea381-8e5d-4ef4-8088-bc990dbc4a13).html). The theme of his current research project is to better understand bio-optics and the dynamics of colored dissolved organic matter in natural aquatic ecosystems.
